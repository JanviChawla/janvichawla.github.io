Beliefs: Family first, offset consumption w/ creation, and ♡ the Oxford comma

I hope to be a Renaissance woman:
- music ~ dancing, playlists, production, piano
- fitness ~ F45, snowboarding
- competitive and intellectual challenges ~ games. Currently solving NYT Tuesday crosswords and optimizing my Rubiks cube solve time
