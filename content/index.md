Born in India, lived the American dream. Currently residing in NYC.

Strategy consultant at the intersection of AI × Product × Healthcare with degrees from Georgia Tech (CS '16) and London Business School (MBA '23)

Family comes first, the Oxford comma is not optional, and creation should offset consumption.

I consider myself a Renaissance woman:
- music ~ dancing, production, anticipating my Spotify Wrapped
- fitness ~ F45, snowboarding
- competitive and intellectual challenges ~ any game. My current obsession is solving NYT Tuesday crosswords.

This is my memory palace for [[concepts]], [[tags/wonderings]], and old [[tags/writings]].
