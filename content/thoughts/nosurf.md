We've become so dependent on our phones, on being accessible to others all the time, that it's uncomfortable to go anywhere without a phone. Portable mini-computers used to be fun and delightful but it was possible to step away. Now as I walk through New York, I see bent necks and phones clutched in hands like crutches.

Consumerism and capitalism have gone off the charts. We tune out the ads we see on billboards, websites, the sides of cars, apps, etc. because it's second-nature to be sold to so aggressively. Everyone's a content creator, and the market is heavily saturated with copycats trying to make quick bucks through shady sponsorships.

There's so much content available that it's all become bland. I deleted Instagram to save some time, and even YouTube offerings seem boring. I increasingly spend more time finding something to watch than watching the content itself; this is especially true for Netflix. I read on r/nosurf that media companies went from creating "good" content to "good enough" content. The second screen has become the TV, and we need something in the background while we scroll on our primary screens - our phones.

It seems people do feel this energy shift in past years because I've heard similarly amongst my friends, family, and coworkers. I'm not sure how society will tackle this as a whole and whether the change will be in the hands of individuals as it currently is or whether the government or private organizations will step up.
