Covid essential

Friend groups

Feeling of belonging

Instead of focusing on how to make ourselves essential outside of being a good person and pulling your weight

Other responsibilities  to make you essential like trip planning and cooking 

More importantly though , the end question on my mind is, how can we make the people we value know that they’re essential. That’s the homework, find 3 people you’ve had deeper meaning connections and let them they’re essential . They’ll feel better and if we all do that maybe we could face the day with a bigger filling in my heart that I belong and that I’m essential. If I wasn’t here, I would be missed.
