my home setup, makeup, shark

  

Not to brag or push anyone towards buying even more items they don’t really need. I myself have been a minimalist for a very long time. It could even be for fear of making a bold decision and regretting it. Regardless of the background/intention, I tend to have few things but the things I do have bring me great great joy. L

  

The reason I wanted to document about my uses is because

1) disclaimer: I do get asked about what I use in these areas so I’m not doing this just to show off, I sincerely hope it helps in decision making and helping curate your setup / makeup / etc.

(2) to some extent obviously show off bc I’m so happy with the things I do have that I want to share, it took a lot of research and trust to get to exactly where I wanted to be

(3) where else would I post if not here. I have Lapse and otherwise occasionally check in on my instagram once a month on the computer. Hence, the memory palace is perfect *cue Rhapsody in Blue*
