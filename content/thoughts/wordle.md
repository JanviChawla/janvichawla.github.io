I want to create a rolling monthly leaderboard for my Wordle group chat. This will be updated as I figure out how to do it.
1. Ask for consent from friends (**sqWORDLES**) to analyze messages
2. Pull rolling 30 days of data from iMessage -- I only keep the last 30 days of messages so I don't have access to before then
3. Determine point methodology
4. What if someone doesn't post every day, or they don't post when they loses? Should this count against them?
5. Parse messages to create leaderboard
6. Format leaderboard message - list of participants and trophies (top 3 places)
7. Text results to group
8. Figure out way to automate on a certain date and time? (optional)
